# TRIM Gene family near the CPR analysis
## My question: How do TRIM family genes near the centromere (CPRs) vary across human populations, and do any of these variations relate to ancient haplotypes (cenhaps) or known disease associations?

# Overview



# Goals
  1. Characterize Genetic Variation
     - Identify how genetic variations near the CPR (Centromeric Proximal Region), specifically the genetic variations of the TRIM family gene, vary across differnet human populations and then link the genetic variants to different geographic regions
  2. Look further into the association of Cenhaps
     - Determine whether these genetic variations are linked to ancient centromere haplotypes (Cenhaps) by looking at population structure and evolutionary history
  3. Explore disease association
     - See whether these TRIM family gene variants are the cause factors to known diseases or associated with traits that can result in those diseases
  4. Visualize the data
     - Visualize the patterns of the genetic variants, compare the visualizations and make the associations through the data visualizations
